# Steam Game Sale Alert Bot

ðŸŽ® Never miss a Steam sale again! This bot monitors your wishlist games and instantly notifies you through Discord when prices drop. Perfect for gamers who want to grab their favorite titles at the best prices.

## Features

- **Sale Monitoring**: Automatically checks game prices via Steam API hourly
- **Discord Notifications**: Sends alerts to your Discord channel when sales are detected
- **User Preferences**: Stores country code, language, and Discord webhook settings
- **Game Database**: Maintains game information in SQLite
- **Sale Tracking**: Prevents duplicate notifications by tracking active sales

## How It Works

1. Fetches game details from Steam API using the game's `app_id`
2. Compares current price with previous price to detect sales
3. Sends Discord notification with game name, price, discount, and image
4. Saves sale details to prevent duplicate notifications
5. Removes games from tracking when sales end
